# KIPFS Security-Focused Acceptance Criteria

## Overview

## Threat Model Assumptions

1. Up to 33% of nodes may be malicious at any given time
2. Malicious nodes may attempt to:

## Conclusion

These acceptance criteria define the security requirements for the KIPFS system operating in an adversarial environment. A secure implementation must satisfy all critical requirements (those marked MUST) and should strive to implement recommended practices (those marked SHOULD).

The fundamental security principle of the KIPFS system is that malicious behavior must always be more costly than honest participation, and detection of fraud must be reliable enough to make the expected value of attacks negative.
